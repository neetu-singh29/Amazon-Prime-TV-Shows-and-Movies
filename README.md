 This project focuses on conducting an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and building a Machine Learning model using Amazon Prime's TV Shows and Movies dataset. The goal is to uncover key insights about content distribution, viewer preferences, and content performance on the platform. Through 15 comprehensive charts and data visualizations, the project explores trends in genres, ratings, content types, and more. Additionally, a machine learning model is developed to predict the likelihood of a show or movie receiving high IMDb ratings, aiding Amazon Prime in content strategy and user engagement improvements.
